# Love-Projects
A collection of the projects I have made to run in Love2D - A Lua based, open source game engine!


As of August 2023, I am putting together this GitHub page to backup and showoff some of the work I've done in Love2D over the past ~2 years. 
These were all personal projects made simply for the joy of it. 

If you are looking to run these files check out Love2D's page here: https://love2d.org/ 

Simply download, then drag any particular project file ("ex. LovePurple") onto the shortcut. (I know this instruction is weird, see this video for an example: https://youtu.be/kpxkQldiNPU?si=PKLx3168Z_u1m9dE&t=222)

I'm putting together a webpage to better show off my love projects before 2024 - Check it out at the link here: WIP - https://four-of-clubs.github.io/Web-Gallery/
